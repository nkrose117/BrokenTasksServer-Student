# Challenge
This application is BROKEN and needs you to fix the issues that are throughout the server build. The previous developer framed everything up but was put on another task before they were able to clean this up and connect everything as needed. This is where you come in...

## Getting Started
- **Fork** this project and then **Clone** it to your workstation.
- Within the project directory, run a `npm install` to install the dependencies necessary for the project.
- You will need to have both **MongoDB** and **Postman** installed for testing everything out.
- Review the `example.env` file to see how to shape your `.env` for this project (see `.gitignore`).

## Concepts That Should Be Understood
- Models / Schemas
- Controllers / Routes
- Connections
  - All of this will be running locally
- Dependencies
- Authentication & Helpers

## Files that ARE NOT Broken
Previous reviewed, it is clear that what isn't broken are the `example.env`, `.gitignore`,`package-lock.json`, and `package.json` files. It also looks like the `index.js` within the **helpers directory** is in working order.

## Main Debugging Concepts
The general concepts of logic is mainly completed; however syntax, connections, and possibly typos are littered throughout the build.

## Number of Bugs
So that you have a light at the end of the tunnel, there are a total of **30** errors within the complete build.
- Base Files
  - 5 issues
- Models
  - 5 issues
- Controllers
  - 15 issues
- Middleware
  - 5 issues
